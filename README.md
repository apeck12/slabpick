# slabpick
Tools to facilitate particle picking and curation from 2D projections of tomography data
from either slabs (projected slices through the full tomogram) or minislabs (projections
of per-particle subvolumes). Minslabs can be formatted as a particle stack for cryoDRGN
and Relion compatibility or a gallery of tiled particle projections for use in CryoSPARC.
Functions to generate starfiles from CryoSPARC-curated particles are also included.
